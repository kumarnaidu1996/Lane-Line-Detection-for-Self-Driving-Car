# Lane-Line-Detection-for-Self-Driving-Car 

This project was started with an intention to develop lane line detection for self driving car where the car detects lane lines on the road and guids the streeting angle to keep moving within the lane also to take turnings. I and my colleague Anil Bollimpalli worked on this project under the professor Klaus Schwarz.
